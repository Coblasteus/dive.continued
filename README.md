# Universal Dive Continued
Welcome to the Universal Dive Continued project!

## Lore
The plot of the game follows Lande residing in a peaceful village before a cosmic disaster strikes. An unknown antagonist triggers a universal-scale supernova that transforms planets into exaggerated, humorous versions of themselves, such as the “Cheesy Moon” and “Mount Gas Storm.” To restore the universe to its original state, Lande must embark on a journey known as the “universal dive,” traveling across worlds to undo the transformations and confront the mysterious villain.

## QNA
### Why did we make this
Us developers from Brick Brothers had spent SO MUCH time on Universal Dive. And then Ralcactus decides to go be like "LeTs ReWoRk ThE gAmE iN gAmE mAkEr", destroying months of hard work.

It's kinda sad for me. That's why I've made this project. To give love to Universal Dive after so much time.

### Information
This is based on the original GDevelop build of Universal Dive.
