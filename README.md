Us developers from Brick Brothers had spent SO MUCH time on Universal Dive. And then doise decides to go be like "LeTs ReWoRk ThE gAmE iN gAmE mAkEr LiTe", destroying months of hard work.

That's it. I had enough of doise's stupid decisions and rules. I'm continuing Universal Dive's development without him.

# Information

# How do I help

# Why is this not a fork?
