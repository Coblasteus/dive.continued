# Universal Dive Continued

Welcome to **Universal Dive Continued**!  

This project is a continuation of the original **Universal Dive** game, based specifically on [this historical branch](https://github.com/lande519/universal-dive/commit/da4ac611a9caea8ac8ac7d4968cae67d6f74f3c1) of the GDevelop version.  
It is **not** a fork of the original repository because the official project later shifted to a GameMaker build, while this continuation focuses on the classic GDevelop version.

## About the Game
**Universal Dive** is a free and open-source action platformer originally developed by the team **Brick Brothers** for an Australian coding competition in 2024. The game was first released as a demo in July 2024 and made open source shortly after.  

The story follows **Lande**, a villager whose peaceful life is interrupted when an unknown antagonist triggers a universal-scale supernova. This disaster transforms planets into exaggerated and humorous versions of themselves—such as the *Cheesy Moon* and *Mount Gas Storm*. To restore the universe, Lande must embark on the "universal dive," traveling across worlds, undoing transformations, and ultimately confronting the villain behind the chaos.

## Why This Project Exists
After Brick Brothers disbanded and the original GDevelop version was replaced with a GameMaker remake, the original version of **Universal Dive** was left behind.  
This project exists to **continue and preserve the GDevelop version**, fixing old issues and expanding on the content while staying true to the original vision.

## Development History
- **Early 2024** – Started as *Food Racer* before becoming **Universal Dive**.  
- **July 2024** – Entered into a coding competition, featuring only the *Cheesy Moon* due to size limits.  
- **September 2024** – Declared “finished,” though many planned levels were removed.  
- **Late 2024** – Source code was replaced by a GameMaker project; the GDevelop build survived only in GitHub history.  
- **August 2025** – Revived as **Universal Dive Continued**, now being developed independently.

## Q&A

### Why continue Universal Dive?
Many of us spent a long time working on the original version, and it was sad to see that effort abandoned when the project shifted engines. This continuation is meant to bring new life to the GDevelop version, while keeping the spirit of the original game intact.  

### Why isn’t this a fork of the original repository?
Forking would link this project to the current GameMaker version, which isn’t what this continuation is based on. Instead, this project draws from a specific archived version of the original GDevelop code.  

### How can I contribute?
If you’re interested in helping, feel free to reach out! You can contact me on Discord or through the community links below. Contributions in coding, art, music, or testing are all welcome.
